This is the Project for GFG Datahack in the Week 3 Assesment of the Summer Analytics 2024 by CA IITG

Here I have First Handeled the missing Values of the data by using the KNN Imputation for the Numerical Value Columns and the mode Imputation for the String Columns

then I have Used One Hot Encoding for the nominal values and Ordinal Encoding for the Ordinal Columns

then I Used Train Test Split with 80 : 20 ratio and Trained the Models

Out of LogReg, KNN, SVM, NaiveBayes -> LinReg and SVM had the best Accuracy but the F1 Score of the LinReg was a Little Better

So I made the Submission CSV from the Logistic Regression Model
